            In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language. The Internet
            was without form and void, and text was upon the face of the monitor and 
            the Hands of Tim were moving over the face of the keyboard. And Tim said,
            Let there be links; and there were links. And Tim saw that the links were
            good; and Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the links
            Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the while thing together 
            was the first Web Page.

            The man think that the leaf-folding action don't affect defence against predators,
            dehydration and maintaing the biological rhythm and metabolism of plants.
            He said that leaf-folding plants offten have needles, needles is more effective 
            against predators than the leaf-folding actions. It's action also doesn't affect dehydration
            because plants folds leaves even when it rains. When it's fain, to reveal that leaf-folding 
            action affects dehydration, we need more evidences. According to the article, leaf-folding 
            action is effective when maintaining the biological rhythm and metabolism of plants. 
            However, the man said that those plants exists under the tree, so the sunshine doesn't 
            affect their biological rhythm and metabolism.
